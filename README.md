# Binary Trees

## Description
In computer science, various [data structures](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/data-structure-project-ideas-beginners/) help in arranging data in different forms. Among them, trees are widely used abstract data structures that simulate a hierarchical tree structure. A tree usually has a root value and subtrees formed by the child nodes from its parent nodes. Trees are non-linear data structures.

A binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent. Every node in a binary tree has a left and right reference along with the data element. The node at the top of the hierarchy of a tree is called the root node. The nodes that hold other sub-nodes are the parent nodes.

A parent node has two child nodes: the left child and the right child. Hashing, routing data for network traffic, data compression, preparing binary heaps, and binary search trees are some of the applications that use a binary tree.

This knowledge is applied to solving each task in this repository.
